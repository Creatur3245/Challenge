# 🧭 Ms. Strange's Geospatial Anomaly Quest — Checkpoint 2

## 🌍 Feature Discovery: Anomaly #3 vs Kuhikugu
This notebook explores **Anomaly #3**, located at **(-4.00, -53.99)**, and its proximity and potential cultural connection to the **historical Kuhikugu site** at **(-10.43, -53.20)**. Both exist within the Amazon basin, particularly within Brazil's vast rainforest zone, long theorized to hold vast archaeological mysteries.

### 📍 Key Discoveries
| Anomaly # | Latitude | Longitude | Radius (m) | Description                            |
|-----------|----------|-----------|------------|----------------------------------------|
| 3         | -4.00    | -53.99    | 50         | Patch of deforestation near waterways  |
| Reference | -10.43   | -53.20    | —          | Kuhikugu ruins (pre-Columbian site)    |

### 🧪 Algorithmic Detection
Using a combination of anomaly detection techniques (LiDAR-based elevation + vegetation variation + Sentinel-2 NDVI change detection), we highlight this site as a potential dig zone.

### 📖 GPT Extracted Cross-Reference
> "*“By the river’s bend, where the red fruit trees thrive, there are echoes of stone where no stone should be.”* — translated from an oral map transcription via GPT-4.1, referencing a location consistent with the anomaly coordinates.

### 🧭 Comparative Analysis
| Feature         | Anomaly #3           | Kuhikugu             |
|-----------------|----------------------|----------------------|
| Elevation       | Topographic shift    | Plateau area         |
| Water Proximity | Near stream/river    | Along river bends    |
| Soil Type       | Lateritic, red clay  | Terra preta zones    |
| Human Impact    | Recent deforestation | Pre-Columbian ruins  |

### 🗺️ Visual Overlay Map
All elements from Checkpoint 1 + additional overlays (e.g. schools, roads, water routes, ecological markers) have been plotted for high-resolution interpretation.
